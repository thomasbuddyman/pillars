**This codebase is now deprecated. We've switched to using [prettier.io](https://prettier.io) because it handles all of this beautifully. You should, too!**

# Pillars

These are the frontend code standards that are used by the whole Hanno team while working on projects. If a client has their own internal code standards in an existing product, these can, of course, override our own.

But in all other cases, we should stick to standards here, so that we can get just a little closer to producing great code, all day long.

For more information about how we work together, check out our [Playbook](http://playbook.hanno.co/)!


#Global Standards

Keep your code simple and DRY, optimise for readability and maintainability.
If you feel like a comment would help your fellow developers understand what a snippet your wrote is doing and why -- add a comment to it.


##General formatting rules

** We've created a simple [SublimeText config](https://github.com/wearehanno/pillars/blob/master/Preferences.sublime-settings) that covers general formatting rules, please use it **

* Use soft-tabs with 2 spaces for indentation. In Sublime Text menu, View > Indentation, check 'Indent using spaces' and 'Tab width: 2'.
* Break long lines after 80 characters so your code is more comfortable to read and easy to scan.
* Check for, and delete, trailing whitespace. [UPD: No need to use the TrailingSpace package--there's a setting in SublimeText that does that for you every time you save a file]

* Avoid inline comments.
* Don't include spaces after opening brackets `(`, `[` or before closing brackets `]`, `)`.
* Don't misspell ;)


##Git

* Avoid merge commits by using a [rebase workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/workflow-walkthrough).
* Squash multiple trivial commits into a single commit.
* Write a [good commit message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).


##Testing and debugging

Always make use of [CSS Source Maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors#toc-how-css-source-maps-work)

For the sake of standardisation and not inventing the wheel, Pillars are partially built upon elements borrowed from [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides), [GitHub](https://github.com/styleguide/css) and [Isobar](http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/), updated and adapted in accordance with Hanno team's own preferences.
